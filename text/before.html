In 2001, I met a fellow who had ridden across the US on his bicycle. He was a normal enough guy, a little pudgy even, and his work and passion were film--editing, directing, screenwriting. I never knew his full name, but he sat across from me in Boulder, Colorado at a cafe while we ate breakfast, and told me tales of his journey. The seeds of desire to follow in his footsteps had been planted. 
<p>
It had been 10 years since I'd ridden a bike. In 1991, I was riding as I frequently did down to the library on my bicycle when I crashed and shattered some bones, requiring surgery and a metal plate which is still grafted to my lower arm today. I was a bit spooked, and hadn't even had a bike since then. However, immediately following that morning in the cafe, I went out and borrowed a friend's bike (and helmet) and rode all over Boulder. I was in love, again. 
<p>
Fast forward back to Austin, a couple of years ago. I finally got a decent bike for christmas one year, and had been putting the miles on it with some friends. I started riding longer and longer distances, culminating in a few 70 mile rides and I'd about hit the peak of what I wanted to do on the bike I had, which was a hybrid mountain/cruiser--heavy, built like a tank, and with medium-sized tires on a mountain-bike-esque frame with front shocks. Which, it suddenly occurred to me, would be perfect for riding around town--no pothole too unexpected to jar me off, no rainstorm too oil-slick-inducing, and no car too unpredictable to be dodged. 
<p>
So I started riding to work every day. Round trip, 7 miles, and it took me just the same amount of time as driving and parking and walking to the office--only I got to park *in* my office. This led to few times when I wouldn't drive for a week. Then a month. Finally, with some encouragement from a few friends without cars, I decided I didn't need my car anymore at the end of this summer. And I've been happy with that decision for the past 3 months. 
<p>
I'd been talking with friends about a long bike ride--how did one ride across the country? I discovered that to my dismay it was either a logistical nightmare (How much stuff can I strap on my bike? What happens when I break down in the middle of nowhere? How much food do I need to carry?) or a tremendous expense (I'll need 3 months off work, and I'll need to pay someone to drive around following me for 3 months carrying my gear...and a spare bike). And then I found out about the <a href="http://www.texas4000.org">Texas 4000</a>. 
<p>
I read a little more about it online, and it sounded great--a supported, cross-country ride at no cost, with a bunch of other young people, at the best time of year. But as I read more, I drew up short. The previous year's riders weren't just talking about the ride in their journals--they were talking about bigger things. Life-changing things. And not things like "I rode 120 miles today and I'm proud of myself!"--things like "I cry almost every day when I think about what we're working against, and who we're working for" and "I have never felt so appreciated and valuable in my life." This thing was obviously not what I was expecting... 
<p>
I submitted my application, still thinking "bike ride, bike ride, bike ride!" and "oh, there will be some fundraising and stuff too." But when I went to the information session, it was obvious that everyone who had done the ride was a true believer--they had battled cancer personally, and the world was a better place. That's what made <b>me</b> cry, what made me change from thinking "this would be a fun summer trip!" to "this is what my life has been missing". 
<p>
I was ecstatic when I was chosen; I told my boss I'd be quitting in 8 months, and I still can't stop talking about it to my friends. I really feel good about this. I am honored to be a part of the tradition, and look forward to bringing smiles to people's faces and helping others get past pain to hope. I feel like I'm doing something to improve my world, and that feels better than anything I can think of. 
<p>
We'll pedal across the country, and we'll raise awareness and educate about cancer prevention. But we'll be riding for a team. Team Homo Sapiens. And we're gonna ride to win a future without cancer--the biggest prize ever. I can't wait!
