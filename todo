in aftermath, what can you do to help the world?

from lindsey j - 

When I think of you, I feel compelled to go out and change the world. I feel the urge to work on myself on many levels, from the physical to mental and spiritual. I feel the urge to purify and to love, to increase my awareness and compassion. To hug.  I feel compelled to make a goal and strive relentlessly to achieve it. I feel like being more of myself and less of what I've been taught to be.  I feel the acute brevity of life and ponder ways of making each day as meaningful as possible.  I feel compelled to look at myself, take a long, hard look, and worship the good parts while healing and transforming the not-so-good. I feel like giving 100% of myself while honoring my Self's needs.
